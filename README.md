# Stock Prediction Analysis using LSTM, KNN Clustering, and CNN

## Overview
This repository contains a stock prediction analysis project that utilizes various machine learning and deep learning techniques to predict stock prices. Three different models have been implemented for stock price forecasting: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for time series analysis, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) clustering for pattern recognition, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image-based analysis of stock data.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- **data:** Contains historical stock data in CSV format.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for each model implementation and analysis.
- **models:** Saved model weights and configurations.
- **results:** Visualizations and evaluation metrics.
- **utils:** Utility scripts and functions used for data preprocessing and visualization.

## Requirements
